# Work Plan

The project is about creating a single-page application using React, SCSS and interaction with an API. The project will be done in the following method:

## Preparation

1. Study the project requirements. Get to know what technologies are to be used for the project.
2. Ask relevant questions to the recruiter if needed.
3. Brush up on some technologies that I haven't been using for awhile or not familar at all. In my case, I am quite familar with React and API, but I need to brush up my SCSS skills. For a quick video tutorial, check this link: [SCSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI) .

## Work Setup

1. Use Vite to setup a ReactJs development environment. I chose to use ViteJs because it is quick to setup, lightweight and fast. This is an ideal setup vs Create-React-App because this is a small project.
2. Setup Git repo to commit changes concurrently with development.
3. Test run using the Vite server.
4. Once the setup is done, try accessing the API.
5. Create the following React Components: Navbar, Header with search, Categories, Joke Cards, Pagination, Footer, etc
6. Style components based on design
7. Combine all components in App.js file.
8. Test functionalities of the product.
9. Refine user interface and experience (UI/UX).
10. Compile the application in Webpack.
11. Commit and push to remote repository.
12. Deploy application via Github pages.
